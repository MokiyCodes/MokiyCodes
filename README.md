### Hi there 👋
I'm 0J3, and I do code and sh\*t i guess?

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to somehow fit my addiction for anime in here and confess that I'm a weeb. Oh wait I just did...
- 💬 Ask me about Node.JS I guess? Well that or anime
- 📫 How to reach me: 0J3#0001 on Discord or gh.contactme@wafflepowered.com
- 😄 Pronouns: Preferably either they/them, or she/her, but I don't care that much
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have been coding since I was 5, joined github on my first account in 2016, and have a total of 629 local repos at the time of writing (and more non-local ones here). These repos count a total of 7GB of files (exclusive dependencies)
- ⚡ Fun fact 2: [https://github.com/0J3-2/](https://github.com/0J3-2/?ref=0J3) is where I put the rest of my things that don't really belong here, ie the [Aurora](https://github.com/0J3-2/Aurora) theme that I now maintain.
